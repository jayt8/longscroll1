  <h1 class="header"> Epelagic Zone </h1>
<p> The epipelagic zone is the surface layer of the ocean. It includes the upper 200 meters or so of the ocean. Sunlight penetrates through this region so it is sometimes called the sunlight or photic zone. Species found in zone are typically sharks, dolphins, and many other common fishes. </p>

   <h1 class="header"> Mesopelagic Zone </h1>
 <p> The mesopelagic zone goes from the bottom of the epipelagic zone to about 1,000 meters deep. The amount of sunlight that passes through this layer decreases quickly. This region is also called the twilight or disphotic zone. One species commonly found here are octopus. </p>

   <h1 class="header1"> Bathypelagic Zone</h1>
 <p> The bathypelagic zone ranges from the bottom of the mesopelagic zone to about 4,000 meters deep. Sunlight barely reaches this region so it is sometimes referred to as the midnight zone. Water temperatures decrease significantly and much fewer species live in this zone. One species that loves to stay around this area of the ocean are Whales .</p>

   <h1 class="header2"> Abyssopelagic Zone</h1>
 <p> The abyssopelagic zone extends from the bottom of the bathypelagic zone to around 6,000 meters deep, or to what we often think of as the ocean bottom. It is the largest ocean zone in terms of volume of water. Despite the lack of light and extreme pressures, species such as the anglar fish still live in this area. </p>
